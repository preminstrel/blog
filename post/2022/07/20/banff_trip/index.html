    <p>When I arrived Edmonton, I have signed up a trip to Banff. After I signed the waiver, I was on the bus to Banff on July 15th. I lived with two Indians and Ruiqi, who is from HUST, majoring in Mechanical Engineering. One of the Indians is called Simha, the name of Lion King, which sounds very ambitious. We have a night chat, and I got to know that universities in India employ the origin English textbooks and teach them in English, which is really a shock to me. Simha said that his major is computer science and he has some papers accepcted by top conference like CVPR and AAAI. His intern toppic is related to ECG diagnosis, extremely resembling my first topic. Just when we are sharing our viewpoint upon the projects, Ruiqi had taken a lot of photos of the sky with twinkling stars.</p>
<p>On July 16th, we waked up pretty early and got a ride to Lake Louise, which I think is the best sencery during this trip. We took enormous photos and chose a very well-taken one as our avater in all social networking accounts. After that, we had a boat floting tour around the moutains on the limpid water. To be frank, it is very cozy for me to enjoy the comfortable wind with tiny sway. We had a lunch at Banff Town and we selected a Chinese resturant for just some appetizers because the main dishes are so expensive that we cannot afford it.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we made the acquaintance of Kinh and Toya, who are from Vitnam and Japan respectly, and now we are Asian Five.</p>
