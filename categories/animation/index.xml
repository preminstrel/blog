      <description>Actually, M24 is similar to other recent releases, which reasoning element is highly reduced while some unscientific and unbelievable phenomenon may happen. To be frank, I clearly know that it is a convert to cater more audience’s demand, including someone who is not interested in mystery stories. Although maybe it is an irreversible transformation, I still hope that M25’s performance can be better in this aspect.
Let&amp;rsquo;s discuss M24 itself. The background of M24 is the 2020 Tokyo Olympic Games, which was not successfully hold in the real world.</description>

      <description>Eclipse First, the Rest Nowhere. Overview Uma Musume Pretty Derby has two seasons, I prefer the later season, adaption based on true story of Tokai Teio (トウカイテイオー). The plot is ordinary, even you can preview the next race’s result. However, Cygames, the producer of Uma Musume anime, made it remarkably extraordinary through its expressive pictures.</description>
